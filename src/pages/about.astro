      <h2>About BlobPlop</h2>
      <p>
        BlobPlop was born thanks to the .com TLD (Top-Level Domain) being available, so I bought it from my favorite domain name registrar: <a href='https://porkbun.com/'>Porkbun</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Blob can refer to any form of content such as text, photo, video, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object'>binary large object</a> to cover all of the above. You get the idea.
        Blobs are gobs of content.
