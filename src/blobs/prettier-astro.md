# How to Get Prettier to Work With Astro

To get this plugin to work you currently need the following npm package:

```
npm i --save-dev prettier-plugin-astro prettier
```

This is the official solution from the Astro team.

I have it saved here as a developer dependency. If and when this changes I will update this post.
